this is an efficient caching problem


cache initialization:
  paginate through all the characters
  data store options:
    redis? fast scallable but not enough indexing, you might need to parse json data later to compare
    sqlite3? it just works then you can 
      keep adding col later and 
      update small amount of data, 
      portable, you will not hassle whoever is testing this

recaching strategies:
  is there an event you can subscribe to? 
    webhooks?
    too bad NOPE there is none

  brute force -> just keep looping through the character pages and updating your db
    its the simplest solution
    but what if there are thousands/millions of characters? 
      its going to suck, it might take too much time to just keep updating/inserting

  you need to segment the data neil
    options:
      creators?
        it will do but what if Marvel ads a new creator you are adding additional layer of complexity Stupid!
      alphanumeric nameStartWith
        yeah segment them by 36 groups [a-z,0-9]
        simplest approach
        test it 

      modifiedSince: modified date
        IS A MORE PRACTICAL QUERY!!!!

  marvel states your are limited 3K requests per day
    server is limited to 125 requests per hour OUCH 
      measure the volume of requests
    well its not like they create characters everyhour or everyday hahahahah
    just cron it once a day or everyhour

todo:
  DONE - setup repo,node,ts

  DONE - db design
    characters
      id
      name
      description

    update_logs
      id: int
      lastUpdate: timestamp

  DONE - marvel api library -> just make the endpoints you are using to work
    test  GET /characters ?modifiedSince
    test getting specific character GET /characters/:character_id
      - might be needed if character requested does not exist in your db so you
        forward the request to the marvel api directly

  DONE - sqlite3 db
    done init() create table if not exist
    getCharacterIds()
    upsertCharacters([char])
    addNewLog()
    getLatestLog()

  init data
    get all the characters pagination

  node server
    - express? nope just use http

    GET /characters
      just query the entire id in the sqlite3
      return ids
  
    GET /characters/:character_id
      query from db return results
        if not exist
          forward request to marvel
          store data in db

  nock service 
    process.env.NODE_ENV=develop
      intercept request of polling service to test whether changes happen add a fake character of your own

  polling service
    cron
      count characters by
